A Dart library for working with 3D geometry.

* It provides classes for working with 2D and 3D vectors, lines, and planes.
* Allows vector operations (dot product, cross product, orthogonality checks), converting lines between different forms (slope-intercept, parametric, symmetric) and embedding 2D geometric objects into 3D space.
